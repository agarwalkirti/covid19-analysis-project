COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT
In this project, I have loaded and explored the COVID-19 and Happiness datasets, cleaned and preprocessed the data, and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and relationships.  Created meaningful visualizations using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly, and merged both datasets to analyze correlations between pandemic impact and happiness indicators such as GDP, life expectancy, and social support. Generated insights by answering questions like whether happier countries had better COVID-19 outcomes, and summarized entire process with clean, well-commented code and visual outputs in a structured Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).
It is designed to assess your ability to handle real-world datasets and applied practical data analysis techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Worked with two datasets:
COVID-19 dataset (e.g., daily confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries by country and date)
Worldwide Happiness dataset (e.g., happiness scores, GDP, social support, health, freedom, etc.)
The main goal is to analyze, visualize, and combine these datasets to derive insightful correlations and understand global trends.
